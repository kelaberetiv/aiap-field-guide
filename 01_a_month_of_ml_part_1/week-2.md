# Python and Data Part II: More Complex Workflows

### Your Mission

1. Last week we set up a local reproducible DS environment with one Jupyter notebook. Now we want to extend reprodubility to multiple scripts and workflows with multiple stages. First, set up another [`cookie cutter data science` project] (https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). 
2. Read [*The Practice of Reproducible Research*](https://www.gitbook.com/book/bids/the-practice-of-reproducible-research/details) for what real-world data workflows and pipelines look like. Construct a similar multi-stage workflow either with Python scripts or upyter Notebooks. 
3. Construct a narrative and message around your analysis. 

This month, we will be banging on the concepts of reproducibility, project design and narrative an awful lot. The idea is that through repetition, these best practices become second-nature.
