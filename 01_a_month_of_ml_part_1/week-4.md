# Python and Data (Advanced) 

### Your Mission: 
Two goals this week: 
1. Explore the cutting-edge Python packages around data visuallisation and handling large datasets 
2. Explore deep learning libraries and benchmark the strengths and weaknesses of each. You may want to start with Quora or Reddit discussions to get a feel for what other people are saying about each framework. Then, draw your own conclusions by running controlled experiments with different libraries.
