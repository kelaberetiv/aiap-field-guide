# Python and Data Part I: Getting Started

### Your Mission

1. Set up a Conda Environment. \(You will need to read the [Anaconda Docs](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) and Conda Cheat Sheets [PDF](https://docs.anaconda.com/_downloads/Anaconda-Starter-Guide-Cheat-Sheet.pdf) and understand what a `conda` environment is, and how it's different from `pip`\)
2. Read [*Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects*](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424) for some ideas on making a Data Science project to be reproducible.
3. Read up on [Cookie Cutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) project and start a new project.
4. You should now have a local environment for Reproducible Data Science. From within that `conda env`, create a Jupyter Notebook that reads in a data file, then cleans, visualises and applies an algorithm to the data. Construct a narrative and message around your analysis.

**Hint: Best practice examples can be found in the books in the resources. It's a good idea to curate a your own personal set of examples of how to wrangle data into a coherent analysis with a message behind it.**

### Resources

For theory:
* [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by Jake van der Plas

* [Python for Data Analysis](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) by Wes Mckinney

* Ned Batchelder: [Loop like a Native](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html)

For examples of how to construct and present an analysis: 
* [A gallery of interesting Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks)
* [FiveThirtyEight Blog](http://fivethirtyeight.com/)

### Extension Question

How would you describe Python's Object-Oriented System? How does Python's design help \(or hinder!\) the iterative process of analysing data?

### Primer and Roundup

Primer: [The importance of metric design and problem scoping](https://medium.com/what-to-build/is-anything-worth-maximizing-d11e648eb56f) 
Roundup Questions: What went well and what didn't? What did we learn? What would we do differently? How can we learn more effectively?
