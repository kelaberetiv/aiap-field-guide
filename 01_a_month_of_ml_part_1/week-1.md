# Python and Data Part I: Getting Started

### Your Mission

1. Set up a Conda Environment. \(You will need to read the Anaconda Docs and Conda Cheat Sheets and understand what a `conda` environment is, and how it's different from `pip`\)
2. From within that `conda env` create a Jupyter Notebook that reads in a data file, then cleans, visualises and applies an algorithm to the data. Construct a narrative and message around your analysis (see resources for examples).

**Hint: Best practice examples can be found in the books in the resources.**

### Resources

For theory:
* Python for Data Science by Jake van der Plas

* Python for Data Analysis by Wes Mckinney

* Nate Batchelder: Loop like a Native

For examples of how to construct and present an analysis: 
* A gallery of interesting Jupyter Notebooks
* FiveThirtyEight Blog
* Ask Mona 
* pudding.cool

### Extension Question

How would you describe Python's Object-Oriented System? How does Python's design help \(or hinder!\) the iterative process of analysing data?
