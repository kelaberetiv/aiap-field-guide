# Here are some values we would like to see in you:
(thanks to https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/ for articulating this so well)

- **Hard work**: We expect you to have a strong work ethic. We love our work, are passionate about the AI mission, and you should not be afraid of giving 110%
- **Flexibility**: You should be willing to dive into different facets of a project. For example, besides using machine learning algorithms, you may also need to work on data acquisition, conduct user interviews, or do frontend engineering. This may also require going outside your comfort zone, and learning to do new tasks in which youâ€™re not an expert.
- **Learning**: You should have a strong growth mindset, and want to learn continuously. This can involve reading books, taking coursework, talking to experts, or re-implementing research papers. We will also prioritize your learning and help point you in the right direction; but you need to put in the work to take advantage of this.
- **Teamwork**: We work together in small teams. You are expected to support and collaborate with others; in turn you will also receive support from your teammates.
