# You will need:

### 1. A scientific mindset

"If you donâ€™t understand how something works, develop a hypothesis, design some experiments, run them, and record the results."  \(Advanced R by Hadley Wickham\)

### 2. When asking for help, a reproducible example

### 3. A hacker's mindset:

### 4. An engineer's mindset

Break down a problem, understand how things work, consider how to optimise a system 

### A de-facto way to test whether you've understood something: 

 - Can I troubleshoot the workflow? 
 - Can I customise the workflow? 
 - How does my workflow/implementation compare to an industry exemplar? For example, if I implement a chatbot, what is the difference in quality between my product and the Google Assistant?
