# Engineering for Reproducibility

In this workshop we will take the Jupyter Notebooks you have put together yesterday and organise them in a reproducible manner

# 1. Primer: what does reproducibility involve? 

Again, map out initial ideas to make them explicit

# 2. Organise Jupyter Notebooks according to these steps/checklist

a. [Steps towards reproducible researsh](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/)
b. [Opinionated Analysis Development] (https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/)

# 3. Further Exploration: 

a. What else might be needed in addition to these tools?
b. How might we **design** for a analysis workflow that balances ease with reproducibility?
