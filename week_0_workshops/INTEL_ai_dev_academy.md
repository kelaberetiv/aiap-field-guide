# Developing an end-to-end ML Product Pipeline 

## Deliverable: 
By the end of this session you should have:   

1. Read through the [Hands-on AI tutorial series](https://software.intel.com/en-us/ai-academy). *In your own words*, summarise each stage of the **AI Journey: From Ideation to Launch** . 
- Ideation and Planning
- Technology and Infrastructure
- Data and Modelling (Images and Music)
- App Development and Deployment

2. implemented these interactive exercises in Jupyter Notebook:
- [Set Up a Portable Experimental Environment for Deep Learning with Docker](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/hands-on-ai-part-10-set-up-a-portable-experimental-environment-for-deep-learning-with)
- [Tensorflow Without a PhD](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0)
- [Deployment: Hands-on AI Part 24: TensorFlow Serving for AI API and Web App Deployment](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/hands-on-ai-part-24-tensorflow-serving-for-ai-api-and-web-app-deployment)

## 1. Primer: Think/Puzzle/Explore 

End goal: 
- visible record of preliminary ideas especially misconceptions/overly simplistic ideas
- leave space for later record of thought evolution

Materials: Shared Google Doc

a. What do you *think* you know about this topic? (map prior knowledge) . 
b. What questions or *puzzles* do you have? (identify areas of interest to pursue) . 
c. What does the topic make you want to *explore?* (groundwork for independent inquiry) . 

## 2. Quiet work on modules 

## 3. Wrap-up : 

Share as a whole group to probe thinking and explanations
a. I used to think..
b. But now, I think...

if time permits - think pair and share

thanks to Harvard Ed for the use of thinking routines in 1 and 2
