# Developing an end-to-end ML Product Pipeline 

## Deliverable: 
By the end of this session you should have one Jupyter Notebook for each academy module 

## 1. Primer: Think/Puzzle/Explore 

End goal: 
- visible record of preliminary ideas especially misconceptions/overly simplistic ideas
- leave space for later record of thought evolution

Materials:
- individual whiteboard space/paper 
- markers

a. What do you *think* you know about this topic? (map prior knowledge) 
b. What questions or *puzzles* do you have? (identify areas of interest to pursue) 
c. What does the topic make you want to *explore?* (groundwork for independent inquiry) 

## 2. Quiet work on modules 

## 3. Wrap-up : 

Share as a whole group to probe thinking and explanations
a. I used to think..
b. But now, I think...

if time permits - think pair and share

thanks to Harvard Ed for the use of thinking routines in 1 and 2
