# Engineering for Reproducibility

In this workshop we will take the Jupyter Notebooks you have put together yesterday and organise them in a reproducible manner

# 1. Primer: what does reproducibility involve? 

Again, map out initial ideas to make them explicit

# 2. Read through these resources/checklist

a. [Steps towards reproducible researsh](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/)
b. [Opinionated Analysis Development] (https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/)

# 3. Does this change how we previously approached reproducibility?

More than that, what design elements do we want to incorporate? Conversely, what design elements do we want to leave out?

# 4. Further Exploration: 

a. What else might be needed in addition to these tools?
b. How might we **design** for a analysis workflow that balances ease with reproducibility?
