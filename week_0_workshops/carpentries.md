# Engineering for Reproducibility

In this workshop we will take the Jupyter Notebooks you have put together yesterday and organise them in a reproducible manner

## 1. Primer: what does reproducibility involve? 

Again, map out initial ideas to make them explicit. The end goal of this exercise is to:

- create a visible record of preliminary ideas especially misconceptions/overly simplistic ideas
- leave space for later record of thought evolution

Questions: 
- What do you think you know about this topic? (map prior knowledge)
- What questions or puzzles do you have? (identify areas of interest to pursue) 
- What does the topic make you want to explore? (groundwork for independent inquiry)

## 2. Read through these resources/checklist

a. [Steps towards reproducible research](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/) . 
b. [Opinionated Analysis Development] (https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/)

## 3. Does this change how we previously approached reproducibility?
Etherpad exercise
More than that, what design elements do we want to incorporate?  
Conversely, what design elements do we want to leave out?

## 4. Quiet work 

[Carpentry workshop on Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
[Carpentry workshop on Unix](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
[Carpentry workshop on Automation and Make](http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/)

## 5. Further Exploration: 

a. What else might be needed in addition to these tools?  
b. How might we **design** for a analysis workflow that balances ease with reproducibility?
