# Setting up your development environment

This is a brief note on how to set up your development environment for success.

## The absolute minimum

We support Windows 10, macOS and Linux as the operating systems of choice in the curriculum. If you are running anything else, please consider running a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu as a VM and use that as your development environment.
