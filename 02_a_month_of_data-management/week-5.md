# Data Architectures 

[Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_architecture#cite_note-1): In information technology, data architecture is composed of models, policies, rules or standards that govern which data is collected, and how it is stored, arranged, integrated, and put to use in data systems and in organizations.

# Your Mission: 

1. Refer to the web resources (wikipedia/developer documentation etc) of the Data Architecture technologies listed below: 
2. Research what an exemplar solution for each technology looks like. 
3. Build an example 

**Data Architecture technologies listed in increasing level of flexibility:** 

Object Storage
* Azure Blob Storage for Cloud
* Minio for on-prem

**Data Warehouses** 
* Hive for SQL-like queries of Hadoop
* Parquet for columnar storage 

**Databases**
* SQL
* Apache Lucene/Solr for Text Analysis 
* Kafka etc. for IOT
* NoSQL \(graphs, column, key-value\)
